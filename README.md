Bright Motors Sales
Overview

This project analyses the Bright Car Sales dataset, which contains daily transactional and pricing data for vehicles sold by Bright Motors.
The objective of the case study was to uncover insights that support:

Expanding the dealership network

Improving sales performance

Optimising inventory and product mix

Understanding customer purchasing behaviour

How the Case Study Was Conducted
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation

Checked for missing values and formatting inconsistencies

Standardised numerical fields (year, selling price, mileage)

Computed and validated the TOTAL_REVENUE field

Ensured all categorical variables were consistently labelled

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed through SQL, Python, and Excel:

Generated summaries by make, model, region, and body type

Explored revenue distributions and price variations

Visualised trends and relationships between key variables

Conducted comparison analysis across locations and time periods

3. Feature and Trend Analysis

Focused on identifying:

Top revenue-generating makes and models

Price–mileage–year depreciation patterns

Regional sales performance differences

Customer preferences (body type, transmission, colour)

Seasonal or emerging purchase trends

4. Data Visualization

Created multiple charts to support insights:

Bar charts – Top-selling models and makes

Pareto charts – High-impact vehicle categories

Scatter plots – Relationship between price, mileage, and year

Line charts – Monthly or yearly sales trends

Stacked charts – Customer preference shifts over time

Key Insights
1. Top Revenue-Generating Model

Explorer Sport Trac generated the highest total revenue.

Insight:
This model should be prioritized for:

Stocking

Marketing campaigns

Supplier negotiations

Potential to become a flagship model

2. Relationship Between Selling Price & Mileage

Selling price decreases as mileage increases.

Insight:
Customers value low-mileage cars, meaning Bright Motors should:

Apply tiered pricing strategies based on mileage

Promote low-mileage vehicles heavily

Add value to high-mileage cars via warranties or service packages

3. Top 10 Preferred Car Makes

Ford is the most preferred and purchased car make.

Insight:
Bright Motors should:

Create Ford-focused seasonal promotions

4. Least Preferred Car Makes

Insight:
These makes show very low demand and may cause:

Slow-moving inventory

Higher carrying costs

Recommendation:

Reduce stocking

Clear remaining units using discounts or trade-in deals
